Mender CLI
========================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains a standalone tool that makes it much easier to work
with the [Mender server management APIs](https://docs.mender.io/apis/management-apis).

The goal with `mender-cli` is to simplify integration between the Mender server
and cloud services like continuous integration (CI)/build automation.

Over time `mender-cli` will be extended to simplify the most common use cases
for integrating the Mender server into other backend and cloud systems.


## Getting started

To start using `mender-cli`, we recommend that you begin with the
[documentation section to set up mender-cli](https://docs.mender.io/server-integration/using-the-apis#set-up-mender-cli).


## Downloading the binaries

You can find the latest `mender-cli` binaries in the [Downloads page on Mender
Docs](https://docs.mender.io/downloads).

## Enabling Bash auto-complete

The `mender-cli` tool can be enabled to support shell autocompletion, like you
are used to for your regular tools, like `git`, `cd`, etc. In order to enable
this functionality the `mender-cli` tool has to be run with the
`--generate` flag. Example:

```console
mender-cli --generate
```

This will output the file `autocomplete.sh` in the `autocomplete` directory in
the directory the binary is run from, so it is recommended to run this from the
`mender-cli` source directory, where this directory already exists.

In order to enable the functionality the current `Bash` shell has to pick up the
completions (i.e., source it). This can be done in one of two ways:

1. Copy the `./autocomplete/autocomplete.sh` file to `/etc/bash_completion.d/`,
   where a new `Bash` shell will automatically source it on invocation.

2. Keep the file where it is, and have each new login shell source the file as a
   part of `.bashrc`. This means that `echo "source
   /path/to/mender-cli/autocomplete/autocomplete.sh" >> ~/.bashrc` needs to be
   present in your `Bash` config.

## Enabling Zsh auto-complete

The `mender-cli` tool supports enabling `Zsh` support, just like [Bash
auto-completion](#enabling-bash-auto-complete).

In order to enable `Zsh` auto-completion do:

```console
mender-cli --generate
```

to generate the auto-completion script.

```console
echo $FPATH
```

Choose one of the directories in the `$FPATH`, and then copy the
`./autocomplete/autocomplete.zsh` script into this directory, and rename it to
`_mender-cli`, and restart your shell. Now typing:

```console
mender-cli [Tab]
```

should result in:

```console
$ mender-cli [Tab]
artifacts  -- Operations on mender artifacts.
login      -- Log in to the Mender server (required before other operation
```
